ProtectedModuleHost.exe is an executable file associated with McAfee Total Protection, developed by McAfee, Inc., and is identified as version 2.15.120.0. It is designed to facilitate various security functions within the McAfee antivirus software framework, particularly in protecting the system from potential threats and ensuring the overall security of the userâ€™s device. Generally considered safe when it is part of the McAfee suite, it can sometimes trigger false positives in other antivirus programs due to its behavior, which may lead users to mistakenly classify it as malware. However, if located in its proper directory within the McAfee installation path, it is not a virus or harmful software. Some users may encounter errors related to this executable, such as crashes or performance issues, which can often be resolved through software updates or reinstallations of the McAfee program. As with any executable file, it is essential to ensure it is legitimate and not a variant of malware masquerading under the same name.
